Hello! I'm Elisa, a neuropsychologist and a researcher in cognitive psychology and educational sciences.

My research focuses on predictive processes in reading and statistical learning in developmental and adult dyslexia. I am particularly interested in the compensatory and protective mechanisms that allow adults with dyslexia to succeed in higher education, and in how these mechanisms relate to language development and learning to read. My long-term goal si to contribute to innovative and personalised educational tools and interventions for learners with reading difficulties.

My current position
======
I'm currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [LaRAC](https://larac.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) (Université Grenoble Alpes, France), working with [Salomé Cojean](https://sites.google.com/view/salomecojean/language-langue/fran%C3%A7ais/cv) and [Laurent Lima](http://laurent.lima.free.fr/). I'm working on the [ATENA project](https://larac.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/recherche/projets-en-cours/atena) which investigates how teachers use digital resources, how they perceive and accept IA-based tools, and how these numeric tools can be better implemented in real educational contexts.

Very recently, my project, PREDYS, have been awarded a Marie Skłodowska‑Curie individual grant for the years 2027-2029 and will explore whether adults and children with (a risk of) dyslexia use predictive language processes as early protective factors or as later-emerging compensatory strategies across reading development.

Previously, I completed my PhD at the [CRPN](https://crpn.univ-amu.fr/fr) (UMR 7077, Aix-Marseille Université, France), under the supervision of [Johannes C. Ziegler](https://crpn.univ-amu.fr/fr/annuaire/ziegler-johannes). My [doctoral research](https://crpn.univ-amu.fr/fr/annuaire/ziegler-johannes) investigated the role of semantic and syntactic prediction and statistical learning in normal reading and developmental dyslexia.
